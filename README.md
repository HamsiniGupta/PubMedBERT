# PubMedBERT: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Biomedical Question Answering

Using the labeled dataset from PubMedQA, we trained the BERT model using SimCSE method to improve RAG with LLMs for biomedical question answering. 
Our implementation of the RAG framework includes testing the PubMedBERT model as our retriever with Llama3-OpenBioLLM-8B (achieving 64%) and Llama-3.1-8B
