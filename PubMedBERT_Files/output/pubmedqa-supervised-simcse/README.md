- source_sentence: 'Maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during gestation in the
    spiny mouse: is this a metabolic adaptation to pregnancy?'
  sentences:
  - Data for 432 participants were entered into the analysis. Recruits in the Army
    sample had a significantly greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment
    resource need than either of the other two Services. Army recruits had a mean
    number of 2.59 (2.08, 3.09) decayed teeth per recruit, compared to 1.93 (1.49,
    2.39 p<0.01) in Royal Navy recruits and 1.26 (0.98, 1.53 p<0.001) in Royal Air
    Force recruits. Among Army recruits 62.7% were from the two most deprived quintiles
    of the Index of Multiple Deprivation compared to 42.5% of Royal Naval recruits
    and 36.6% of Royal Air Force recruits.
  - In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer
    hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our
    results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective
    surgery.
  - Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to
    late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n
    = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total
    creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes
    arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase
    (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein
    expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.
- source_sentence: We replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. using data
    on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gmünder ErsatzKasse (GEK) in
    2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 children aged
    0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey
    for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006.
  sentences:
  - The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement
    in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic
    antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.
  - Alcohol-associated cues elicit craving in human addicts but little is known about
    craving mechanisms. Current animal models focus on relapse and this may confound
    the effect of environmental cues. OBJECTIVES. To develop a model to study the
    effects of environmental cues on alcohol consumption in animals not experiencing
    withdrawal or relapse.
  - When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma medications
    were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other respiratory
    diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had prescriptions.
    We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a good proxy for
    the disease.
- source_sentence: Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for
    the ureter?
  sentences:
  - The participants' mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age was 74.7 +/- 12.2 years.
    Almost one half of them (n = 46; 44.7%) were considered to have severe vision
    impairment (presenting visual acuity<6/60 in the better eye). Disordered thresholds
    were evident initially. Collapsing the two middle categories produced ordered
    thresholds and fit to the Rasch model (chi = 10.1; degrees of freedom = 9; p =
    0.34). The mean (SD) items and persons Fit Residual values were -0.31 (1.12) and
    -0.25 (0.78), respectively, where optimal fit of data to the Rasch model would
    have a mean = 0 and SD = 1. Unidimensionality was demonstrated confirming the
    construct validity of the PHQ-9 and there was no evidence of differential item
    functioning on a number of factors including visual disability. The person separation
    reliability value was 0.80 indicating that the PHQ-9 has satisfactory precision.
    There was a degree of mistargeting as expected in this largely non-clinically
    depressed sample.
  - There were 7 type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV.
    Four cases developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III). Hawkins
    sign was observed in 12 cases, of which none developed necrosis. Four cases with
    negative Hawkins sign developed necrosis. No statistically significant differences
    were found when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the displacement
    of the fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment. Differences were found
    when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the Hawkins sign (P=.03).
  - The success rate was 92.7% at the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months.
    The failures were secondary to retropulsion of the stones (3.3%). There were no
    perforations and one stricture. Stenting was done in 90% of patients.
- source_sentence: Does intra-abdominal desmoid disease affect patients with an ileal
    pouch differently than those with an ileorectal anastomosis?
  sentences:
  - This study aims to determine whether the clinical effects of abdominal desmoids
    would be worse in patients with restorative proctocolectomy than in patients with
    ileorectal anastomosis.
  - Pretreatment with ibuprofen before elective total hip surgery increases the perioperative
    blood loss significantly. Early discontinuation of non-selective non-steroidal
    anti-inflammatory drugs is advised.
  - Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible
    cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography
    surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown
    origin.
- source_sentence: A prospective cohort study was conducted across a tertiary care
    and private community hospital. Ninety-four patients underwent colonoscopy and
    polypectomy of diminutive (≤5 mm) polyps from October 2012 to July 2013, yielding
    a total of 159 polyps. Polyps were examined and classified according to the Sano-Emura
    classification system. The endoscopic assessment (optical diagnosis) of polyp
    histology was used to predict appropriate colonoscopy surveillance intervals.
    The main outcome measure was the accuracy of optical diagnosis of diminutive colonic
    polyps against the gold standard of histological assessment.
  sentences:
  - Endoscopists within a tertiary care setting can accurately predict diminutive
    polyp histology and confer an appropriate surveillance interval with an associated
    financial benefit to the healthcare system. However, limitations to its application
    in the community setting exist, which may improve with further training and high-definition
    colonoscopes.
  - The length of stay decreased significantly over the 4 years for all of the four
    categories, the smallest change being observed for patients with AMI (11.1%) and
    the largest for those with bronchitis or asthma (22.0%). The readmission rates
    for AMI, bronchitis or asthma, and TURP showed no consistent change over the 4
    years. The readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly
    between the first and second year (chi 2 = 4.28, p = 0.04) but then remained constant
    over the next 3 years. The mean number of physician visits increased slightly
    for AMI in the first year (1.92 to 2.01) and then remained virtually the same.
    It decreased slightly for bronchitis or asthma over the 4 years. There was no
    significant correlation between length of stay and readmission rates for individual
    hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four categories. Also, no correlation was observed
    between length of stay and mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals
    in 1992-93 in the categories AMI and bronchitis or asthma.
  - Diagnosis of PAD was made in 122 subjects (29.2%) with AAI<0.90. After a 3 year
    follow-up 203 patients (48.6%) died. The presence of PAD was not related to total
    mortality or to mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease
    or other causes. IHD mortality was significantly and independently related to
    low haemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy and poor
    mobility conditions.
