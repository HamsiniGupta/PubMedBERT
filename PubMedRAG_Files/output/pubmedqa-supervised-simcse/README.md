- source_sentence: Are sports medicine journals relevant and applicable to practitioners
    and athletes?
  sentences:
  - Studies on coronary risk factors in men and women are mainly based on mortality
    data and few compare results of both sexes with consistent study design and diagnostic
    criteria. This study assesses the major risk factors for coronary events in men
    and women from the Reykjavik Study.
  - There is a dearth of studies addressing diagnostic and treatment interventions
    in the sports medicine literature. The evidence base for sports medicine must
    continue to increase in terms of volume and quality.
  - Hypotheses for this discontent are presented. Physicians may be uninterested in
    helping caregivers; even if they were receptive to counseling caregivers, they
    could be poorly remunerated for the types of counseling sessions that are usual
    for caregivers; and being a professional caregiver to family caregivers is demanding
    in itself.
- source_sentence: Is Bare-Metal Stent Implantation Still Justifiable in High Bleeding
    Risk Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?
  sentences:
  - 'Compared with patients without, those with 1 or more HBR criteria had worse outcomes,
    owing to higher ischemic and bleeding risks. Among HBR patients, major adverse
    cardiovascular events occurred in 22.6% of the E-ZES and 29% of the BMS patients
    (hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.98; p = 0.033), driven
    by lower myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%; p<0.001) and target vessel revascularization
    (5.9% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.005) rates in the E-ZES arm. The composite of definite
    or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in E-ZES recipients, whereas
    bleeding events did not differ between stent groups.'
  - MDA on its own was insufficient to control the prevalence of schistosomiasis,
    intensity of Schistosoma infection, or morbidity of the disease. Alternative control
    measures will be needed to complement the existing national MDA program.
  - A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide
    secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation
    for people post stroke.
- source_sentence: 'In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants
    with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role?'
  sentences:
  - 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct
    to ultrasound-guided LCNB. The advantages of 3D ultrasound validation are likely
    to include a reduction in the number of core samples needed to achieve a reliable
    histological diagnosis (and a possible reduction in the risk of tumor cell displacement),
    reduced procedure time and lower costs.
  - We identified 102 consecutive infants with surgically confirmed IHPS and determined
    the thickness of the pyloric mucosa compared with the thickness of the surrounding
    hypertrophied muscle. Fifty-one infants who did not have pyloric stenosis served
    as controls.
  - Broad-based electronic health information exchange (HIE), in which patients' clinical
    data follow them between care delivery settings, is expected to produce large
    quality gains and cost savings. Although these benefits are assumed to result
    from reducing redundant care, there is limited supporting empirical evidence.
- source_sentence: Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke?
  sentences:
  - There is no standard protocol for the evaluation of antiseptics used for skin
    and mucous membranes in the presence of interfering substances. Our objective
    was to suggest trial conditions adapted from the NF EN 13727 standard, for the
    evaluation of antiseptics used in gynecology and dermatology.
  - Post-operative version or percentage of DFV>15Â° did not significantly differ following
    IMN of diaphyseal femur fractures between surgeons with and without trauma fellowship
    training. However, prospective data that removes the inherent bias that the more
    complex cases are left for the traumatologists are required before a definitive
    comparison is made.
  - The statistical power of this case-referent study was such that only large beneficial
    effects of statins in acute stroke could be confirmed. However, the observed trend,
    together with experimental observations, is interesting enough to warrant a more
    detailed analysis of the relationship between statins and stroke outcome.
- source_sentence: The aim of this study was to describe the evolution and epidemiologic
    characteristics of shigellosis patients over a 25 year period in a large city.
  sentences:
  - There was no difference between the two groups in the number of emboli detected
    (p=0.49) and no significant correlation between number of emboli and dissection
    time (r=0.0008). However, there was a significantly higher number of emboli in
    the patient sub-group that were current smokers (p=0.034).
  - An increased trend was detected in men who had no history of food poisoning or
    travel to endemic areas. This increase points to a change in the pattern of shigellosis,
    becoming predominantly male and its main mechanism probably by sexual transmission.
  - There is a trend for progressively increasing mean intra-osseous length associated
    with increased flexion of the knee. The mean intra-osseous length for 70Â° flexion
    was 25.2 mm (20 mm to 32 mm), which was statistically significant when compared
    to mean intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm) and 38.0 mm (34 mm to
    45 mm) in the 90Â° and 120Â° flexion groups, respectively (p<0.05). There were no
    significant differences among the groups with respect to distance to the LCL.
    There is a trend toward longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased
    flexion. There was a statistically significant dif - ference when comparing 120Â°
    versus 70Â° (p<0.05).
